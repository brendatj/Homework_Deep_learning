        "In this homework, we will explore how to develop a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis. We will use the IMDB dataset---it contains the text of some reviews and the sentiment given by their authors (either positive or negative). The input to the RNN is the sequence of words that compose a review, so the learning task consists in predicting the overall sentiment of the review.\n",
        "In the first part, we will learn how to develop a simple RNN, then we will explore the differences in terms of computational load, number of parameters, and performances with respect to more advanced recurrent models, like LSTM and GRU. Subsequently, we experiment with the bi-directional model to unveil the strengths and the weaknesses of this technique. Finally, we will solve the same classification problem with a Transformer, in order to have a closer look at its internal functioning.\n",
